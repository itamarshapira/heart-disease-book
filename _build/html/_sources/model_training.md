# Model Training and Methodology

This section outlines the methodology used to train the machine learning model for predicting heart disease.

## Model Selection
We experimented with several models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), CatBoost , XGBoost and Random Forest, to determine the most effective approach. As shown in the chart below, **Logistic Regression** emerged as the most robust model with an accuracy of over 0.88.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Ensured there were no missing values in the dataset, as they could impact the modelâ€™s performance.

## Model Training
- Data was split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets to evaluate model performance effectively.
- **Cross-Validation**: A 5-fold cross-validation strategy was used to ensure the model's robustness and reduce overfitting risks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed using:
  - **RandomizedSearchCV** to explore a wide range of hyperparameters efficiently.
  - **GridSearchCV** to fine-tune the most promising hyperparameter values identified earlier.
  - *Note: Hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV initially, followed by a more exhaustive GridSearchCV to fine-tune the Logistic Regression model.*

## Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using several metrics, such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**, as summarized in the classification report. Additionally, a confusion matrix was used to provide insights into the model's predictive capabilities.
