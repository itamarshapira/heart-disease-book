# Welcome to Heart Disease Prediction Book

Welcome to the **Heart Disease Prediction Showcase**, an in-depth exploration of using machine learning and data analysis to assess heart disease risk. This book highlights the most significant findings and visualizations from the project, focusing on key insights without diving into detailed code.

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early and accurate prediction crucial. By leveraging various **data science techniques** and **machine learning models**, this project aims to identify important risk factors and provide transparent, data-driven predictions.

ðŸš€ **Explore the Full Notebook**: To interact with the code and run the full analysis, check it out on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/itamarshapira/heart-disease-ml-notebook/blob/main1/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb#scrollTo=83943af1-74d1-476c-8527-a2dd20c1c3bd&line=1&uniqifier=1).
```


Within this book, you'll find:
- A **Data Dictionary** to familiarize yourself with the medical attributes used in the analysis.
- Clear and insightful **visualizations** that reveal the relationships between features and their impact on heart disease risk.
- An emphasis on **model interpretability**, ensuring that the results are not just accurate but also understandable.
- My Work FLow : six steps I followed to create this project, sharing interesting thoughts and insights along the way.

Explore how data and technology come together to address a real-world health challenge and gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning can be applied to predictive healthcare.
